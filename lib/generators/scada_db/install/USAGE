Description:
    Copies the basic structure of the DB into the local mounting app.

Example:
    rails generate install

    This will create:
        db/diff.applied
        db/diff.new
        db/dump
        db/dump/development.sql.bz2
        db/seed

    The first 2 folders can be used to store (and commit) SQL diff/log
    files to be applied with the dedicated rake task (db:diff_apply)

    To rebuild the DB using the copied dump, use its dedicated rake
    task db:rebuild_from_dump.

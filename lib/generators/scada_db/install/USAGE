Description:
    Copies the basic structure of required files and folders into the local
    mounting app tree.

Example / Usage:
    > rails g scada_db:install

    This will:

      1. prepare the base folder structure for the DB management; typically:
            db/diff.applied
            db/diff.new
            db/dump
            db/seed

      2. copy the latest available (committed) DB structure dump
         into the dedicated folder:
            db/dump/development.sql.bz2

      3. copy any available factory into the mounting app
         spec/factories folder

      4. copy any available spec/support file into the mounting app
         spec/support folder


    The db/dump folder contains the structure dumps that can be recreated
    easily with:

      > zeus rake db:rebuild_from_dump # (when using Zeus)
      ...Or...
      > bundle exec rake db:rebuild_from_dump

    The additional db/diff.new and db/diff.applied folders can be used
    to store SQL diff files to be applied to the dump using the dedicated
    rake task db:diff_apply

    Check out the corresponding rake task descriptions for more info.
